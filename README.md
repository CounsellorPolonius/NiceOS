# NiceOS

Operating system with vanilla Linux kernel for users who wants to take full control of their system. You can do it, try it!

## Minimal example

You can watch me building minimal preset on [youtube](https://youtu.be/4CH8b0HnIu8)

```bash
mkdir -p /data/src/nice # recommend hdd folder with few spare gigs
git clone 'https://github.com/solcloud/NiceOS' /data/src/nice
cd /data/src/nice
$EDITOR _config.sh # read carefully and make modifications
export NICE_PRESET=minimal # presets by default lives inside presets/ folder
make download # download linux and busybox compressed releases
make build
make cmd # or make gui , qemu cmd quit shortcut 'Ctrl-a x'
```

For more presets look at _presets/_ folder, there is _base_ as a starting template and few my personal presets

## Promo

Everybody likes screenshots right ðŸ™‚ here is my ðŸ‘»

## Advance example

bulding my main desktop system - _Ghost_ ðŸ‘» with binaries extracted from artix (Pá—£á—§â€¢â€¢â€¢Má—£N)

```bash
cd /data/src/nice
export NICE_PRESET=ghost
DISTRO=artix DISTRO_ISO=/data/dwn/artix-base-openrc-20210726-x86_64.iso make extract
make build
make gui
```

For extracting binaries from other distribution just look at _distro_extractor/_ folder. We virtually provide extract recipes for every linux distro ever made ðŸ˜‰ For example if you prefer _debian_ binaries over _arch_ just use something like `DISTRO=devuan DISTRO_ISO=/path/to/devuan_chimaera_4.0.0_amd64_minimal-live.iso make extract`

## User's presets

If you have own presets in different folder than default _presets/_ folder, you can use `NICE_PRESET_ROOT` variable, eg:

```bash
cd /data/src/nice
export NICE_PRESET_ROOT=/home/me/nice/my_presets
export NICE_PRESET=my_custom_preset
make build
```

## Build dependencies

For debian system you will probably need these packages

```bash
sudo apt install git make gcc rsync bison flex cpio bc libelf-dev gawk fdisk wget lbzip2 xz-utils dosfstools libncurses-dev # required
sudo apt install qemu-system-gui qemu-utils # optional (for running and extracting in QEMU emulator)
```
